This repository will serve as exploratory for me, while learning Deep Learning. I will maintain it as best and frequently as I can, as I explore Deep Neural Network architecture.

Keras:

    NN_Keras.ipynb is an implementation of a full-connected Neural Network that analyzes data from a diabetes dataset (the data is present in the repository).

    cnn_cifar is an implementation of a convolutional Neural Network that implements image recogniition on objects such as airplanes, dogs, frogs, horses, cats, ships, etc; achieved 69.9% accuracy.

    cnn_mnist is an implementation of a convolutional neural network for image classification on hand-written digits; I achieved 95.31% accuracy on it.

PyTorch:

    Follow alongs doing the Tutorials;

    Tensors: basics of PyTorch tensors

    Autograd: PyTorchâ€™s automatic differentiation engine that powers neural network training.

    Neural Networks: skeleton NN in PyTorch
    
    Convolutional Neural Networks: basic Convolutional Neural Network in PyTorch to classify CIFAR10 (currently 54% accuracy)
